# What is it about? 

goCab is an app that gets you a cab (a real, licensed cab) on-demand anywhere, anytime. Just like any other taxi transportation app, you only need to write an address (or not) and press a button to call a taxi, and the closest available one will come right to you (either geolocated position or entered address). 

## What goCab offers more

There are also many other features that goCab can offer such as: 
* a seamless, user-friendly experience
* the possibility to constantly monitor during the ride the real cost + a complete breakdown of the different taxes and surcharges (airport pickup surcharge, after 10pm surcharge... that are always added at the end of the ride and no one ever knows what they really are and how much)
* automatically tip a certain percentage of the trip cost at every ride
* when no cab is available nearby (which, by personal experience, really really sucks)
